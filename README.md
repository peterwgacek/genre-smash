# Genre Smash!

Genre Smash is an app that returns a randomized movie based on the genre the user enters into the search fucntion. I was inspired to make this app as I think a randomized search by genre on my individual Netflix queue would be a nice feature to have. 

## Getting Started
 [Click Here](https://peterwgacek.github.io/project-one/) to see the deployed app. Simply type in what movie genre you want to search for and press the 'SMASH!' button.

## User Stories:
- As a user I should be able to enter in a genre and get back a random movie to help me figure out what movie I want to watch
- As a user I should be able to enter in another genre or try again with the same genre 



## Stretch Goals/Future Goals:
- add a coursel selector interface for the genre selection
- be able to randomzie from a user's queue or watch list
- add a modal for the return selection
